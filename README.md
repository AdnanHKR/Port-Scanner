# Port-Scanner
is a simple Python tool that checks which TCP ports on one or more target hosts are open. It accepts hostnames or IPs (single or comma-separated list), resolves hostnames to IPs when needed, then tries to connect to a range of TCP ports and optionally reads a service banner when available.
