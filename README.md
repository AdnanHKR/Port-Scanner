# Port-Scanner
It is a simple CLI Based Python tool that checks which TCP ports on one or more target hosts are open. It accepts hostnames or IPs (single or comma-separated list), resolves hostnames to IPs when needed, then tries to connect to a range of TCP ports and optionally reads a service banner when available.

# Usage (how to run)

2. pip install IPy
3. Run: python PortScanner.py
4. enter a hostname or IP (or multiple hosts separated by commas): [ google.com or 142.250.200.174 ]
